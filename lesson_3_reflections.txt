When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I want to use a remote reposository when I want to share my work, and when I want to save my work safely in the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because I want to have control over what changes I'd pull and where to pull them into.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are copies of repositories on the GitHub side that allow me to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original profject. I can contribute back to the original project using the prull requests.

- Clones are local copies on my computer that I can sync between both the locala nd the remote locations of the project. Unlike forks, I can't pull down changes from the original repository I cloned from, and if the project is owned by someone else, I can't contribute back to it unless I'm invited as a collaborator. Cloning is good when I need a way to quickly get my own copy of a repository where I may not contribute to the original project.

The work flow is...

1) First, fork a project repository on GitHub, and
2) Clone it down to my local computer, then
3) Add a Git remote to my clone that points to the original project repository on GitHub, so that I can push changes back up to the forked repository in my GitHub account using git commit (to add commits locally) and git push.

- Branches are a way to create a separate line of changes, which is independent from the main line (often referred to as "master"). Branches allow multiple users to make changes to a repository at the same time, so when I collaborate with others on GitHub, I should create a branch.

The basic flow on my local Git repository:

1) Create and checkout a feature branch using git checkout -b new-feature
2) Make changes to the files
3) Commit my changes to the branch using git commit (Add the changes to the staging first by using git add new-feature)
4) Push the changes to Git using git push <remote> <branch> (ie. git push origin new-feature)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I can go offline and compare the differences between my local master and origin/master. I don't need to merge the two right away.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would collaborate via email, shared Google Drive and other data sharing resources. It would be harder to collaborate this way because it'd create more overhead on communnication about changes and updates.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I want to make changes directly in the master branch when I have obvious simple changes that all the collaborators are expecting me to make right away. It's quick and creates no over head this way. Whereas, I want to make changes in a separate branch when I have more complicated changes or I'm making changes that others don't necessarily know about, which I'd like to notify via "pull request" for efficient communication. My collaborators will get notified about my chagnes when I tried to merge my branch with changes into the master branch.
