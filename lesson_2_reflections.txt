What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.

Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory, which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository. This metadata includes subdirectories for objects, refs, and template files. A HEAD file is also created which points to the currently checked out commit.

Your first instinct, when you start to do something new, should be git init. You’re starting to write a new paper, you’re writing a bit of code to do a computer simulation, you’re mucking around with some new data … anything: think git init.
